# blokus
Included in this project are methods I coded for a command line playable version of the game blokus coded in C#.
Blokus is an abstract strategy board game for two to four players, where players try to score points by occupying most of the board with pieces of their colour.

NOTE: This project was coded for the BME 121 Final Exam so some of the code was not written by me. I have denoted this throughout!

Background info: 

Blokus only has one rule: each new piece played must touch at least one other piece of the same colour,  but only at the corners. 

Coding Strategy:

There were four main methods I needed to create to ensure a playable game:
1. Display the current board
2. Place a piece on the board
3. Check to see if the piece is place-able
4. Verify the piece satisfies Blokus rule

All these involved a lot of array manipulation but I succesfully coded it all in under an hour. 

Credits to Professor George Freeman for giving me permission to showcase this!
